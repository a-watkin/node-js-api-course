# Seven primitive data types of Javascript

1. null
2. undefined
3. number
4. boolean
5. symbol
6. string

I used to recall it with: BUNNSS

1. Boolean - true, false

2. Undefined -

3. Null

4. Number

5. Symbol - each symbol is a unique, it is used to identify object properties.

6. String

But now there's also BigInt

7. BigInt - precision number limited only by the avaialble memory of a system.
