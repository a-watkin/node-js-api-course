# Types of relationship

## Using references (Normalisation)

Allows for consistency.

A document has a reference to another document.

## Embedded documents (Denomalisation)

Allows for better performance at the cost of consistency if an update failes.

One document is embedded in another.

## Hybrid approach

Some properties of a document are embedded in another but not all of them.

Allows for snapshots of relivant data again increasing performance while also allowing for some greater level of consistency.

# Each of the above approaches has advantages and drawbacks
